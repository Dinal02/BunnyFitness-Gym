# BunnyFitness-Gym
It is a website about a gym in a town, It containes details of the gym, services offered by the gym, details of various membership plans and their pricing, contact information of the gym, etc.

I created this project while learning web development. I learnt HTML and CSS and made this project.

So it is made using only HTML and CSS and It is not fully Responsive. You can directly view it in desktop web browser.
